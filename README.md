# How to Get Unbanned on Throne and Liberty (2025 Guide) 🏰

Getting banned from Throne and Liberty can feel like getting locked out of your own castle — and not in a fun fantasy way. If you think the ban was a mix-up or just want back in the game ASAP, this straightforward guide will walk you through what to do and how to appeal for the best shot at reclaiming your throne.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban shadow follow you no matter how many new accounts you create, or hit you right after starting fresh? That’s probably an **HWID ban** (Hardware ID Ban)! Throne and Liberty has locked onto your PC’s unique hardware imprint, which means new accounts won’t save you without a little tech magic.

An HWID spoofer might just be your secret weapon to bypass that hardware ban and jump back into the fray.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check any emails or notifications from the Throne and Liberty team to know exactly what caused your exile. Typical reasons include:
- Using cheats, hacks, or third-party tools  
- Toxic or abusive behavior towards other players  
- Account sharing or suspicious login activities  

**Pro tip:** Skim through the game’s Terms of Service before sending an appeal — you want to sound like you actually read it.
